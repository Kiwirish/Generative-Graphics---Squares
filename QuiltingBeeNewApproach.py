# scaling issue to be fixed - other scales based off first layers scale, 
# first layers scale doesn't necessarily have to be largest scale. 
# 1.0 255 0 0 \n 1.2 0 255 0 \n 0.1 0 0 255 should display correctly 

# new approach:
#   
#  still use tkinter window for quilt drawing but take from stdin 
#  - issues encountered with GUI and scaling 
#  input is put into tuple list containing 'scale r g b' to store 
#  Before drawing, calculate what total size of quilt will need to be from scales in tuple list 
#  
#  Draw first square at canvas center then draw next layers squares at corners of previously drawn square(s). Repeats for all input lines 
#  Once all layers drawn, quilt displayed in tkinter window. 
# 
#  DrawSquare function gets all points of last square to draw new square off and draws that, returning coords/positions of the corners of that new square 
#  
# so, once input is stored into a tuple list, dimensions are calculated and canvas fitted to that calculation, then 
# the first square is drawn, with the coordinates for the corners of it being returned and stored so we know where to center 
# the next layer of squares. Then we loop over the square tuples holding scale r g b and 
# for each corner of the first square and for each coordinate in each corner, draw a new square at that current corner,
# append that to some storage for the current corners

# 10 april version 

# Pick a display / canvas size FIXED and then scale the quilt to fit the display size 
# scale the quilt with CalculateScaleFactor method rather than 
# CalculateDimensions which calculated the canvas size dependant on the quilt scales. 
# CalculateScaleFactor will scale each square drawn in the quilt to the FIXED CANVAS size instead 

# ACTUALLY read from stdin, not just 'open' the input file 
# 14 April version
# ensure scale factor is within reasonable range - test different ranges.
# if squares are smaller than 1 pixel then dont draw 

# 16 April version 
# successfully scaling up but not scaling down. For small inputs, it scales it up well. 
# But for large inputs, it doesnâ€™t scale it down, its just a huge zoomed in quilt. 
# new scaling function
