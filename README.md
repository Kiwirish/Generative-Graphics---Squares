# Etude 4 

My final working QuiltingBee program is within FinalQuiltingBee.py, which is a cleaned up version only containing code used in the final version. 

QuiltingBee.py contains tests and attempts with less layers to aid in my understanding prior to the recursion for arbitrary numbers of layers. 

### To compile, run and test my program: 

 - Click 'run' in editor or enter the following into terminal: 
      - *python3 FinalQuiltingBee.py*
        

 - Then enter input lines into GUI box pop-up. Click 'Draw' to submit your input lines.
